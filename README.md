### Hi there 👋
I'm a Software Developer specialised in PHP. I have always been interested in programming and when a close friend of mine, who works in thid field, showed some projects she did, I got inspired to also learn programming. I'm always working on my current skills with the goal of being more confident each day in what I do and my experience with Codelex is helping me with this goal.
